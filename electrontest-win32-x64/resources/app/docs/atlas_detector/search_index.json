There were about 30 collisions on average per bunch-crossing.  \nAn event is the data resulting from a particular bunch-crossing. \nPile-up is defined as the average number of particle interactions per bunch-crossing.\nIt is directly correlated with the instantaneous luminosity.  \nLuminosity is one of the most important parameters of the LHC.\nThe higher the luminosity, the more data the experiments can gather to allow them to observe rare processes.\nHowever, increasing luminosity increases pile-up.\nThis presents a challenge for physics analyses as it makes successfully identify collisions of interest harder.\nThe primary vertex is defined as the inelastic collision of two protons with the highest overall transverse momentum.\nIn a typical collision event, several vertices along the beam are produced.\nIt is important to correctly identify them to associate the observed particles to the correct vertex to suppress the effects from pile-up.\nThe many low transverse momentum proton-proton interactions occuring are called minimum bias events.\nThe above event display shows a candidate Z boson decaying into two muons with 11 reconstructed vertices. This event was recorded on April 24th and is typical for the 2011 environment with high pile-up.\nThe reconstruction of vertices is important for many physics studies.\nThis includes searches for new particles, identifying jets containing b-quarks or taus, and reconstruction of exclusive b-quark decays.\n"},"the-higgs-boson.html":{"url":"the-higgs-boson.html","title":"The Higgs Boson","keywords":"","body":"The Higgs Boson\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a theory that describes the known matter in terms of its elementary constituents and their interactions. It is a widely proven and very successful theory in modern physics.  \nThe Higgs boson is a fundamental particle, first observed by ATLAS and CMS in 2012, although theorised in the 1960s. The Higgs boson is the carrier particle for the Higgs field, a field present throughout our universe, which gives particles their mass. The more a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the higher its mass.\nHiggs boson production\nStandard Model production of the Higgs boson at the LHC is dominated by the\n\ngluon fusion process: gg \\rightarrow H\n\nfollowed by the\n\nvector-boson fusion process: qq' \\rightarrow qq'H\n\nAssociated production also have sizeable contributions, with\n\na W boson :\na Z boson :\nor a pair of top quarks: q\\bar q/gg \\rightarrow t\\bar t H\n\nSmaller contributions are expected from production in association with\n\nb-quarks : b\\bar bH\na single top quark : tH\n\n\nThe figure above shows the Standard Model Higgs boson production cross sections as a function of the center of mass energy, \\sqrt{s}, Ôøºfor pp collisions. Effectively, how likely each type of Higgs production is, for different LHC energies.  The theoretical uncertainties are indicated as a band PDG.\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) and Electroweak (EW) models are used to predict the production cross sections. Next-to-leading order(NLO) and next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) calculations are carried. High order corrections are required to achieve the desired precision for these predictions.\nHiggs decay\nAccording to the Standard Model, the Higgs boson can decay into pairs of fermions or bosons. \nThe Higgs boson mass is not predicted by the Standard Model, but once measured the production cross sections and branching ratios can be precisely calculated.\n\nThe Standard Model Higgs boson decay branching ratios and total width are shown in the figure above [PDG]. You can see that the decay modes change in prominance depending on the mass of the Higgs, M_{H}.  \nEffectively, this diagram expresses how likely the Higgs is to decay into a certain particle, or group of particles, depending on the mass of the Higgs.\nThe Higgs mass has now been measured to be125 GeV (see combined measurement by ATLAS and CMS).We can see from the figure above that the prominent decay modes at M_{H}= 125 GeV are\n\n H \\rightarrow b\\bar b\n H \\rightarrow WW\n\nfollowed by\n\n H \\rightarrow gg\n H \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau{-}\n H \\rightarrow c\\bar c\n H \\rightarrow ZZ \n\nThe following table displays the branching ratios and the relative uncertainty for a Standard Model Higgs boson with mass M_{H} = 125 GeV PDG.\n\nThe decay mode with the highest branching ratio (BR) is the decay to hadrons, BR \\sim 70%, which is not easy to detect due to QCD background.\nA large fraction of the leptonic decays are to a pair of neutrinos, BR \\sim 20%, which are difficult to detect since they hardly interact with matter.\nThe decay to pairs of electrons, muons and taus have a BR of about 10% of the total.\nIn fact, the tau life time is very short, 3x10^{-13}s, so it can be reconstructed only from its decay products. The efficiency of reconstructing taus is much lower than that of electrons and muons. So essentially, focusing on decays into electrons and muons, we are chasing just 6% of all the possible Higgs produced in the LHC.\n"},"analyses.html":{"url":"analyses.html","title":"Analyses","keywords":"","body":"Analyses\nHistogram Analyser focusses on four physics processes; the signal Higgs boson process H\\rightarrow W^+W^- and three background processes WW, t\\bar t and Z.Let's take a look at these processes.\nH\\rightarrow W^+W^-\nThe Higgs boson is an essential ingredient of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that describes all known elementary particles and their interactions.\nThe Higgs boson interacts with all Standard Model elementary particles having mass.  Thus, there are different ways to produce a Higgs boson, and different ways for a Higgs boson to decay to other particles.\nOne of the most likely ways a Higgs boson will decay is into a pair of W bosons.  This happens about 21% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV.  The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark-antiquark (q \\bar q), a lepton-antineutrino (\\ell^- \\bar\\nu), or an antilepton-neutrino (\\ell^+\\nu) pair.\nThe signal process in Histogram Analyser is the Higgs boson decaying into two W bosons which subsequently decay into leptons  (\\ell) and neutrinos (\\nu):\nH\\rightarrow W^+W^-\\rightarrow \\ell^+ \\ell^-\\nu \\bar\\nu\n(lepton = electron or muon in this case).\nA key feature, or signature of this signal process, is an isolated high-p_\\text{T} lepton.  The term p_\\text{T} stands for transverse momentum, the component of momentum perpendicular to the beam line (colliding protons).  Unfortunately, the main background processes also contain isolated high-p_\\text{T} leptons from W or Z boson decays.\nOften physicists refer to a particle and its antiparticle collectively by just the particle's name.  So, when we talk about quarks we mean quarks and antiquarks.  Similarly for leptons and antileptons,  neutrinos and antineutrinos.  It is a shorthand that physicists adopt for brevity.\n\nWW\nThe W boson is a fundamental particle. Together with the Z boson, it is responsible for the weak force, one of four fundamental forces that govern the behaviour of matter in our universe.\nW boson pair production occurs via\n\nquark‚Äìantiquark annihilation: q\\bar q \\rightarrow W^+W^-\n\ndiphoton process:  \\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow W^+W^-\n\ngluon fusion: gg\\rightarrow W^+W^-\n\n\nW boson pair production is an important process for checks of the gauge structure of the Standard Model and the search for new physics. It is an irreducible background for many Higgs boson studies and new physics searches.\nW bosons can decay either\n\nleptonically: into an electron or muon and neutrino. \nhadronically: into an up-type quark and a down-type quark.\n\nLeptonic W boson decays are characterised by the presence of a highly energetic isolated lepton and large missing transverse momentum.  Missing transverse momentum can occur due to neutrinos escaping detection.\nHadronic W boson decays lead to the presence of two jets due to the two quarks.\nOnly leptonic decays are considered in Histogram Analyser.  The WW process will thus be seen in the electron-electron (ee), muon-muon (mm) and electron-muon (em) channel.\nFinal states with leptons and missing energy are typical for many new physics models, supersymmetry is a classic example, but also for many Standard Model processes.\nUnderstanding the Standard Model processes possessing multiple leptons and missing energy is crucial in the quest to discover or rule out new models.\n\nt\\bar t\nData simulation generators, QCD models and parton distribution functions are very reliant on theoretical models. Due to the very high energy of top pairs, top pair data can verify important areas of the aforementioned models and test how good the models are.\nTop quark pair production is an important background in various Higgs boson analyses and beyond the Standard Model searches. It is therefore crucial to understand this process in detail.\nTop quarks decay with close to 100% probability into a W boson and a bottom quark. The W in turns decays equally to a pair of leptons or a pair of quarks.  Since there are three colours for every quark the W boson decay to two jets is three times more probable than its decay to an electron or a muon.\nThe two bottom-quarks from the two top-quark decays will be seen as two jets in the final state.Algorithms are used to identify these jets. Jets thought to originate from b-quarks are called b-tagged jets.Additional jets in t \\bar t  events can originate from gluon radiation.\nSince almost all the energy of the decay products is derived from the rest energy of the top/anti-top pair, finding the total energy of all the decay products and summing should yield the rest energy (and therefore mass) of the particles that have decayed.  But the detector can only \"see\" the charged particles.  It misses the neutrinos produced in the decay.\n\nZ\nThe W and Z bosons are together known as the weak or intermediate vector bosons.\nAt the LHC, Z bosons are produced by:\n\nDrell-Yan :  q \\bar q \\rightarrow Z/\\gamma^* \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-(65%). A quark of one proton and an antiquark of another proton annihilate, creating a virtual photon or Z boson which then decays into a pair of oppositely-charged leptons.\n\nQuark gluon scattering: qg \\rightarrow qZ/Œ≥^* \\rightarrow q\\mu^+\\mu^‚àí (35%). A quark and a gluon interact and the quark radiates a virtual photon or Z boson which then decays into a pair of oppositely-charged leptons.\n\n\nA Z boson then decays into a:\n\nquark-antiquark pair (70%). These appear as jets.  If the jets are identified as originating from b-quarks they will be b-tagged.\n\nneutrino-antineutrino pair (20%).  Neutrinos do not interact and so are very difficult to detect.  This neutrino decay mode can sometimes be identified by missing transverse momentum.\n\nlepton-antilepton pairs (10%).  The three lepton-pair types are equally probable, electron-positron, muon-antimuon, and tau-antitau pairs.\n\n\nA Z boson is neutral and so the sum of the charges of its decay products must be zero.\nIn Histogram Analyser the lepton-antilepton pair production can be studied in the electron-electron (ee) and muon-muon (mm) channel.  Decays to taus are not considered in Histogram Analyser since lectrons and muons are much easier to measure than taus.\n\n"},"data-and-simulated-data.html":{"url":"data-and-simulated-data.html","title":"Data and Simulated Data","keywords":"","body":"Data and Simulated Data\nData\nThe ATLAS collaboration has released 1 inverse femtobarn (1/fb) of data.

Cuts preferentially remove the unwanted processes (background) but leave as much as possible of the desired process (signal).  It is useful to have a good understanding of the physics processes involved when applying cuts.\nWe have created two Histogram Analysers, to help visualise the data:\nThe first Histogram Analyser displays just simulated events.The second Histogram Analyser displays both real data and simulated events.  Both histogram analysers display four physics processes.\nThe four processes are H\\rightarrow W^+W^-, WW, t\\bar t and Z.These processes are discussed in the next chapter.

The description of each follows.\nExpected Number of Events for 1/fb\nThis histogram shows the number of events expected to be detected, reconstructed and recorded by ATLAS for 1 inverse femtobarn (1/fb) of data.One inverse femtobarn corresponds to approximately 100 trillion proton-proton collisions.\nThe expected number of events reconstructed and recorded by ATLAS is different to the number of events produced.Some events will not be reconstructed due to the way the detector is constructed, the resolution of the sub-detectors, reconstruction efficiency and other inefficiencies.\n\nWith no cuts, we have seventeen H\\rightarrow W^+W^- events, with a total background of 613349 events.  The majority of the background is Z boson production.\nThe significance of the  H\\rightarrow W^+W^- events quantifies how \"significant\" the Higgs sample is with respect to the background.  It is calculated by (\\text{Number of } H\\rightarrow W^+W^- \\text{events}) / \\sqrt{\\text{Number of background events}}).The larger the significance value is, the better job you have done extracting the Higgs signal.\nChannel\n\nThe leptonic decay channels are shown here: dielectron (ee), dimuon (mm) and electron-muon (em).Decays to taus or hadrons are not considered in Histogram Analyser.\nHistogram Analyser showing just simulated data, displays three leptonic channels.  Histogram Analyser showing simulated and real data, displays just the electron-muon channel, so this histogram is not displayed.\nReconstructed Dilepton Mass [GeV]\nThis histogram displays the mass reconstructed from the two leptons in the final state.\n\nWith no cuts, this peaks at 90 GeV, due the huge Z boson contribution.\n\nWe can remove a large number of Z boson events by selecting Reconstructed Dilepton Massto be less than 75 GeV, whilst hardly touching our Higgs signal.The H\\rightarrow W^+W^- sample significance increases from 0.021 to 0.110 with this cut.It is thus a useful quantity to use to reduce the huge Z boson background.\nNumber of Jets\nNumber of jets found in the event.\n\n\nWhen selecting two or more jets we see that the Z boson contribution decreases (from 611276 to 25422) and the t\\bar{t} contribution becomes more important.\nSelecting two or more jets, the ratio of ttbar to Z events increases from 1334/611276 = 0.002 to 1038/25422 = 0.04 and the green ttbar contribution is now noticeable in the histograms.\nTop-quark pair production leads to WW+jets final states.\nAre Jets b-tagged?\nJets originating from b-quarks are identified and labelled, or tagged, using so-called b-tagging algorithms.\n\nb-tagged jets are expected in top quark decays, but not in leptonic W or Z boson decays.\nSelecting 'Are Jets b-tagged' as yes, the ratio of ttbar to Z events increases from 1334/611276 = 0.002 to 1041/7227 = 0.14 and the green ttbar contribution is now noticeable in the histograms.\nMissing Transverse Momentum (MET) [GeV]\nIn the LHC, the initial energy of the colliding partons (quarks or gluons) along the beam axis is not known.This is due to the energy of each proton being shared and constantly exchanged between its constituents.\nHowever, the initial momentum of particles travelling transverse to the beam axis is zero.Therefore, any net momentum in the transverse direction indicates missing transverse momentum.\nMissing transverse momentum is used to infer the presence of non-detectable particles such as the neutrino.It is also expected to be a signature of many predicted physics events beyond the Standard Model, for example the lightest supersymmetric particle.\nThe standard abbreviation for missing transverse momentum is MET, for historical reasons.\n\nZ boson decays to charged leptons do not have any neutrinos in the final state while the other processes do.That is why requiring missing transverse momentum removes Z boson events.\nSelect missing transverse momentum and watch how the ratio of WW and ttbar to Z events changes.\nTotal Lepton Transverse Momentum [GeV]\nThis is the vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of the observed charged leptons.\n\nFor Z boson events, total lepton transverse momentum peaks at zero since the transverse momenta of both leptons cancel each other.\n\n\nFor the other processes this cancellation is not as pronounced.Their distributions peak at between 30 and 80 GeV.\nOpening Angle Between Leptons [phi]\n\nThis is the opening angle, measured in phi (ùúô), between the two leptons.The azimuthal angle \\phi is measured from the x-axis, around the beam.\nIn the event display above, two lepton tracks are displayed in red and the opening angle between the two leptons is marked in blue.\n\nIf the leptons are emitted back-to-back, this is displayed on the histogram as 180 degrees.H\\rightarrow W^+W^-events show a peak at low values in contrast to all other processes.\nOpening Angle Between MET and Leptons [phi]\nThis is the opening angle, measured in phi (ùúô), between the missing transverse momentum (MET) and the two leptons.\n\nIn the event display above, missing transverse energy is displayed by the dotted yellow line.  The midline between the two lepton tracks (the direction of the vectorial sum of their transverse momenta) is represented by the dotted red line.  The opening angle between the MET and leptons is shown in yellow.\nEvents with t\\bar t and Z show a relatively flat distribution in this variable whereas H\\rightarrow W^+W^- and WW peak at large values.\nThis is a useful discriminant to remove background events.\n"},"histogram-analyser-2.html":{"url":"histogram-analyser-2.html","title":"Histogram Analyser 2","keywords":"","body":"Higgs to WW - simulated + real data\nThe second Histogram Analyser includes data.

However, the Z background is much reduced, so that makes it a good choice.\n\nThe numbers shown in Number of Expected Events is calculated by the simulated Monte Carlo, as before.\nWe have also added a new histogram, transverse mass. Transverse mass is analogous to invariant mass, but neglects the longitudinal momenta of the decay products.\n\nTransverse mass, m_T, is a useful quantity to define for use in particle physics as it is invariant under Lorentz boost along the z direction. In natural units it is:\nm_T^2 = m^2 + p_x^2 + p_y^2 = E^2 - p_z^2\nwhere the z-direction is along the beam pipe and so p_x and p_y are the momentum perpendicular to the beam pipe and m is the invariant mass.\nIn this study, transverse mass is defined as\nm_T = ((E_T^{ll} + E_T^{miss})^2 - | p_T^{ll} + E_T^{miss} |^2 ) ^{1/2} \nwhere \n E_T^{ll} = (|p_T^{ll}|^2 + m_{ll}^2 )^{1/2} \nIf you select just the Higgs events by clicking on the H \\rightarrow WW in 'Expected Number of Events' histogram, you will see the transverse mass of the Higgs.

There are two types of detector components: tracking detectors, which measure the position of a crossing charged particle with minimal disturbance, and calorimeters, which measure the energy of a particle by total absorption.\nTravelling from the collision point outwards there exist tracking detectors (inner detector), then calorimeters (electromagnetic and hadronic) and then more tracking detectors (muon spectrometer).\nThe complete ATLAS detector is split into a barrel part, where detector layers are positioned on cylindrical surfaces around the beam axis, and two end-cap parts, where detector layers are positioned in planes of constant z perpendicular to the beam pipe.\nATLAS coordinate system\nThe coordinate system of ATLAS is a right-handed coordinate system with the x-axis pointing towards the centre of the LHC tunnel, and the z-axis along the tunnel. The y-axis is slightly tilted with respect to vertical due to the general tilt of the tunnel.\nAzimuth angle, phi (\\phi)\nThe azimuthal angle \\phi is measured from the x-axis, around the beam.The ATLAS detector design is symmetrical in phi.\nPseudorapidity (eta)\nThe pseudorapidity describes the angle of a particle relative to the beam axis.\nOpening angle\nThe opening angle (also called angular separation) between physics objects e.g.lepton pair, can be important in understanding or identifying different physics processes.  It is calculated as a function of eta and phi.\nMonte-Carlo generators\nMonte-Carlo generators are programs used for simulating data.\nGood Run List\nGood run lists are the way to select good data samples for physics analysis.\nThere are a number of ways the data may not be good e.g the LHC is not in stable-beam mode, the magnets are off, some of the sub-detectors are switched off.\nJet\nJets are the dominant final state objects of high-energy proton-proton interactions at the LHC. They are key ingredients for many physics measurements and for searches for new phenomena. Jets are observed as groups of topologically-related energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeters, most of which are associated with tracks of charged particles as measured in the inner detector. They are reconstructed and calibrated using a combination of methods based on simulation and data-driven techniques.\nGood, bad and ugly jets\nJet cleaning criteria have been developed in order to identify fake jets which arise due to noise or to out-of-time energy depositions. Jets failing these criteria are flagged as either ‚Äúbad‚Äù, likely to be fake, or ‚Äúugly‚Äù, likely to be mismeasured due to falling into less well instrumented regions.\nJet Vertex Fraction (JVF)\nThe Jet Vertex Fraction can be used to select jets with a high fraction of track energy originating from the selected primary vertex.  It can be used to suppress pile-up jets.\nIsolation\nIsolation is important because it indicates where the lepton stems from.\nFor example, an isolated electron is likely to originate from Z boson, W boson or \\tau-lepton.  In contrast, a non-isolated electron is likely to originate from b-hadron or c-hadron decays.\np_{T}\nThe term p_{T} stands for transverse momentum, the component of momentum perpendicular to the beam line.\nIn proton-proton collisions the overall momentum along the beamline is not known.  This is because protons are composite particles consisting of many partons (quarks and gluons).  When two protons collide it is actually the partons that interact.\nEach of the partons carries an unknown fraction of the protons momentum.  So their exact momentum along the beamline is unknown.  We only know that the overall momentum perpendicular to the beamline is zero before the collision.  Thus, transverse momentum is the most important momentum variable in a proton-proton collision.\nEvent\nAn event is a snapshot of a collision in the LHC. Energy is equivalent to mass, so highly energetic collisions can create particles more massive than those involved in the collisions (protons, in the case of the LHC). These massive particles quickly decay into lighter stable particles. Physicists study the decay products of collisions to determine what particles were created in the events.\nSignal\nHigh-energy physicists, whether making a precise measurement of a known quantity or searching for hypothetical new particles, select from the sample of events recorded those with characteristics resembling those of the desired signal, while rejecting as many non-signal events (background) as possible.\nBackground\nData contains both signal and background events.  Background events are rejected so that the desired physics processes can be observed.\nFundamental Particles\nFundamental particles are the building blocks of matter as they are all indivisible. All other particles are therefore  a combination of the fundamental particles.\nFundamental Forces\nThe fundamental forces, explain the interactions between particles in our universe. These  forces are gravity, electromagnetism, the strong and the weak force. Electromagnetism and the weak force are linked through the electroweak theory.\nFermion\nA subatomic particle, such as a nucleon, which has half-integral spin and follows a statistical description given by Fermi and Dirac.\nBoson\nA subatomic particle, such as a photon, which has zero or integral spin and follows a statistical description given by S.N. Bose and Einstein.\nChannel\nThe decay channel signifies a certain route a physics process has taken.\nFor example, the W boson may decay to either a pair of hadrons or a pair of leptons. The signature for these W bosons in the detector are therefore either two hadrons or two leptons. These may be referred to the hadronic and leptonic channel of the W boson decay, respectively. If we want to study an object we cannot directly observe, e.g. a W boson, we must find a channel that is easily accessible.\nIn general, decays to leptons are easiest to spot but are not as abundant as hadronic decays.\nBranching fraction\nIn general, a particle can decay in several modes or decay channels.\nFor example, a Z boson can decay into a pair of neutrinos, a pair of charged leptons, or a pair of quarks (i.e., all the standard model fermions lighter than half the Z mass). The probability for a Z to decay into a neutrino pair is about 20%, into a pair of charged leptons (electrons, muons, or taus) is about 10%, and into a pair of quarks (u,d,c,s,b) is about 70%. These probabilities are called branching fractions.\nElectron Volt (eV)\nOne electron volt is equal to ~1.6 X 10^-19 joules.MeV (10^6) and TeV (10^12) are units of energy used in particle physics. 1 TeV is about the energy of motion of a flying mosquito.\nAntiparticle\nAntimatter: A particle and its antiparticle have the same mass as one another, but opposite electric charge and other quantum numbers. A collision between any particle and its antiparticle partner leads to their mutual annihilation, giving rise to various proportions of photons, neutrinos, and sometimes less massive particle‚Äìantiparticle pairs.\nParton Distribution Functions\nThe momentum distribution functions of the partons (quarks and gluons) within the proton are called Parton Distribution Functions.\nVectorial sum\nA vectorial sum is the result of adding two or more vectors together via vector addition.\n"},"particle-physics-masterclasses.html":{"url":"particle-physics-masterclasses.html","title":"Particle Physics Masterclasses","keywords":"","body":"International Masterclasses\nTake a look at the International Masterclasses.\n\n"}}}
