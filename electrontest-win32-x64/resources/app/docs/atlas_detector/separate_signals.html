<p>Let&apos;s look at the simulated data.<br>Using the Histogram Analyser we can look at each sample separately and understand a little more about their characteristics.<br>This will help us separate our <a href="GLOSSARY.html#signal" class="glossary-term" title="High-energy physicists, whether making a precise measurement of a known quantity or searching for hypothetical new particles, select from the sample of events recorded those with characteristics resembling those of the desired signal, while rejecting as many non-signal events (background) as possible.">signal</a> from the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#background" class="glossary-term" title="Data contains both signal and background events.

<li>The reconstructed mass from the two leptons peaks at 25-45 GeV. </li>
<li>The majority of Higgs events contain 0 or 1 <a href="GLOSSARY.html#jet" class="glossary-term" title="Jets are the dominant final state objects of high-energy proton-proton interactions at the LHC.

<li>The analysis considers electron and muon decays of the <script type="math/tex; ">W</script> bosons, so the events occur in all three channels. </li>

</ul>
<p>Overall, the distributions are not so different from those for <script type="math/tex; ">H\rightarrow W^+W^-</script>, hence it is a difficult <a href="GLOSSARY.html#background" class="glossary-term" title="Data contains both signal and background events.

<h2 id="top-quark-pair-production-t-bar-t">top quark pair production (<script type="math/tex; ">t \bar t</script>)</h2>
<p>The top quark is the heaviest subatomic particle ever observed, with a mass that is about as heavy as an entire atom of gold. Top quarks are also among the most fleeting of particles, with a lifetime of about a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.</p>
<p>Due to its high mass and short lifetime, the top quark provides a unique environment to study a bare quark.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/separateSignals/ttbar.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the individual histograms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The events occur in all three channels. </li>
<li>The reconstructed mass from the two leptons peaks at around 80 GeV.</li>
<li>The majority of <script type="math/tex; ">t\bar t</script> events contain at least 2 jets.</li>
<li>Most events have b-tagged jets. </li>
<li>The total lepton transverse momentum peaks around 60-70 GeV.  </li>
<li>Missing transverse momentum is larger than seen in <script type="math/tex; ">H\rightarrow W^+W^-</script> and <script type="math/tex; ">WW</script> events.</li>
<li>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#opening-angle" class="glossary-term" title="The opening angle (also called angular separation) between physics objects e.g.lepton pair, can be important in understanding or identifying different physics processes.
