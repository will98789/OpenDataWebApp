<p>ROOTbrowser also allows you to take a look at some prepared HEP histograms. </p>
<p>An analysis has been implemented for single <script type="math/tex; ">W</script> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#boson" class="glossary-term" title="A subatomic particle, such as a photon, which has zero or integral spin and follows a statistical description given by S.N.

<p>The drop-down menu (second text box) contains a number of examples of final plots from this <script type="math/tex; ">W</script> analysis.</p>
<p>As before, select the file you are interested in</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/ROOTfiles.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case &apos;examples_final_ploys/WtMass.root</p>
<p>Press &apos;Load&apos; button</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/LoadFile.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then display the histogram.  In this case, click on &apos;WtMass;1&apos;</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/WtmassPlot.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Data is displayed with black filled dots.
The various simulated samples are shown in filled colours, stacked ontop of each other.  The overall shape of the combined simulated samples is very similar to the data distribution.  There is fairly good agreement between data and simulated data.  </p>
<p>The <script type="math/tex; ">W</script> analysis is potentially prone to QCD contributions as there is only one lepton present which may come from non-prompt sources mimicking the desired final state. Therefore, potential disagreements must always be understood as a sign that the QCD contributions are not taken into account. QCD samples were not included as these have very low statistics after a selection while having a large file size.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/WMET.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The distributions of the transverse mass as well as the missing transverse momentum are affected by the omission of QCD contributions, which predominantly populate the low missing transverse momentum and low transverse mass regions.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/LeptonPt.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The magnetic field bends the charged particles thus allowing measurement of the momentum by using the curvature of the tracks.
The histogram shows the momentum of the lepton transverse to the beam.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/MutlipleDataInfo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you hover your cursor over a data point, statistics boxes will be shown.  The bottom box shows the information for data, so in this case there are 858 leptons with <script type="math/tex; ">p_T</script> between 50 and 60 GeV.  The top statistics box shows the total simulated data contribution, 961.4 entries.  </p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/LeptonEnergy.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lepton energy is measured by the electromagnetic calorimeters.
The overall description of the lepton kinematics by the simulated data is good.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ROOTbrowser/Tracking.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Less well described are the tracking and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#isolation" class="glossary-term" title="Isolation is important because it indicates where the lepton stems from.">isolation</a> variables.
This suggests that QCD contributions are missing.
