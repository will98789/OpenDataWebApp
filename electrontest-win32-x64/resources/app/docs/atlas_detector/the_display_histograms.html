                                <h1 id="histogram-analyser">Histogram Analyser</h1>
<p>Physicists use <strong>cuts</strong> to select events of interest.  Cuts preferentially remove the unwanted processes (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#background" class="glossary-term" title="Data contains both signal and background events.  Background events are rejected so that the desired physics processes can be observed.">background</a>) but leave as much as possible of the desired process (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#signal" class="glossary-term" title="High-energy physicists, whether making a precise measurement of a known quantity or searching for hypothetical new particles, select from the sample of events recorded those with characteristics resembling those of the desired signal, while rejecting as many non-signal events (background) as possible.">signal</a>).  It is useful to have a good understanding of the physics processes involved when applying cuts.</p>
<p>We have created two Histogram Analysers, to help visualise the data:
The first Histogram Analyser displays just simulated events.<br>The second Histogram Analyser displays both real data and simulated events.  Both histogram analysers display four physics processes.</p>
<p>The four processes are <script type="math/tex; ">H\rightarrow W^+W^-</script>, <script type="math/tex; ">WW</script>, <script type="math/tex; ">t\bar t</script> and <script type="math/tex; ">Z</script>.<br>These processes are discussed in the next chapter.  Each process is represented by a different colour in Histogram Analyser.</p>
<h2 id="make-cuts-using-your-cursor">Make cuts using your cursor.</h2>
<p>Use the cursor to select a specific range in one of the histograms.<br>The selected ranges will be coloured, whilst non-selected ranges will be greyed out.  When you make cuts on a variable the relative contributions of the four processes will change.</p>
<p><strong>To clear your selection on a specific histogram click on the white <a href="GLOSSARY.html#background" class="glossary-term" title="Data contains both signal and background events.  Background events are rejected so that the desired physics processes can be observed.">background</a> within the histogram area. </strong></p>
<p><strong>To clear all your selections click on &quot;Histogram Analyser&quot; under Get Started in the main top menu.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-histograms-explained">The histograms explained</h2>
<p><strong>Higgs to WW - simulated data</strong>
Histogram Analyser displays nine histograms.  The description of each follows.</p>
<h2 id="expected-number-of-events-for-1fb">Expected Number of Events for 1/fb</h2>
<p>This histogram shows the number of events expected to be detected, reconstructed and recorded by ATLAS for 1 inverse femtobarn (1/fb) of data.<br>One inverse femtobarn corresponds to approximately 100 trillion proton-proton collisions.</p>
<p>The expected number of events reconstructed and recorded by ATLAS is different to the number of events produced.<br>Some events will not be reconstructed due to the way the detector is constructed, the resolution of the sub-detectors, reconstruction efficiency and other inefficiencies.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/NumbersNoSelection.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>With no cuts, we have seventeen <script type="math/tex; ">H\rightarrow W^+W^-</script> events, with a total <a href="GLOSSARY.html#background" class="glossary-term" title="Data contains both signal and background events.  Background events are rejected so that the desired physics processes can be observed.">background</a> of 613349 events.  The majority of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#background" class="glossary-term" title="Data contains both signal and background events.  Background events are rejected so that the desired physics processes can be observed.">background</a> is <script type="math/tex; ">Z</script> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#boson" class="glossary-term" title="A subatomic particle, such as a photon, which has zero or integral spin and follows a statistical description given by S.N. Bose and Einstein.">boson</a> production.</p>
<p>The <strong>significance</strong> of the  <script type="math/tex; ">H\rightarrow W^+W^-</script> events quantifies how &quot;significant&quot; the Higgs sample is with respect to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#background" class="glossary-term" title="Data contains both signal and background events.  Background events are rejected so that the desired physics processes can be observed.">background</a>.  It is calculated by <script type="math/tex; ">(\text{Number of } H\rightarrow W^+W^- \text{events}) / \sqrt{\text{Number of background events}}</script>).<br><strong>The larger the significance value is, the better job you have done extracting the Higgs <a href="GLOSSARY.html#signal" class="glossary-term" title="High-energy physicists, whether making a precise measurement of a known quantity or searching for hypothetical new particles, select from the sample of events recorded those with characteristics resembling those of the desired signal, while rejecting as many non-signal events (background) as possible.">signal</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="channel">Channel</h2>
<p><img src="pictures/channel.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The leptonic decay channels are shown here: dielectron (ee), dimuon (mm) and electron-muon (em).<br>Decays to taus or hadrons are not considered in Histogram Analyser.</p>
<p>Histogram Analyser showing just simulated data, displays three leptonic channels.  Histogram Analyser showing simulated and real data, displays just the electron-muon <a href="GLOSSARY.html#channel" class="glossary-term" title="The decay channel signifies a certain route a physics process has taken.">channel</a>, so this histogram is not displayed.</p>
<h2 id="reconstructed-dilepton-mass-gev">Reconstructed Dilepton Mass [GeV]</h2>
<p>This histogram displays the mass reconstructed from the two leptons in the final state.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/DiLeptonMassNoCuts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With no cuts, this peaks at 90 GeV, due the huge <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/listings/rpp2012-list-z-boson.pdf" target="_blank"><script type="math/tex; ">Z</script> boson</a> contribution.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/MassCutLess75.png" alt=""><br><img src="pictures/NumbersMassCutLess75.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can remove a large number of <script type="math/tex; ">Z</script> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#boson" class="glossary-term" title="A subatomic particle, such as a photon, which has zero or integral spin and follows a statistical description given by S.N.

<p>Number of jets found in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#event" class="glossary-term" title="An event is a snapshot of a collision in the LHC.

<p>When selecting two or more jets we see that the <script type="math/tex; ">Z</script> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#boson" class="glossary-term" title="A subatomic particle, such as a photon, which has zero or integral spin and follows a statistical description given by S.N.

<p>Selecting two or more jets, the ratio of ttbar to <script type="math/tex; ">Z</script> events increases from 1334/611276 = 0.002 to 1038/25422 = 0.04 and the green ttbar contribution is now noticeable in the histograms.</p>

<h2 id="missing-transverse-momentum-met-gev">Missing Transverse Momentum (MET) [GeV]</h2>
<p>In the LHC, the initial energy of the colliding partons (quarks or gluons) along the beam axis is not known.<br>This is due to the energy of each proton being shared and constantly exchanged between its constituents.</p>
<p>However, the initial momentum of particles travelling transverse to the beam axis is zero.<br>Therefore, any net momentum in the transverse direction indicates missing transverse momentum.</p>
<p>Missing transverse momentum is used to infer the presence of non-detectable particles such as the neutrino.<br>It is also expected to be a signature of many predicted physics events beyond the Standard Model, for example the lightest <a href="http://home.cern/scientists/updates/2013/10/supersymmetry-searches-atlas" target="_blank">supersymmetric</a> particle.</p>
<p>The standard abbreviation for missing transverse momentum is MET, for historical reasons.</p>
