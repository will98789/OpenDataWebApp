        <p>You have a choice of ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>If you want to have a quick look at the ATLAS Open Data 2016 datasets, not investing too much time, you can use the <strong>small virtual machine</strong>, which contains 10% of the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset.  This takes about 15 minutes to download and setup.  <a href="http://opendata.atlas.cern/books/current/openatlasdatatools/_book/gettingstarted.html" target="_blank">Go to the Software Book to learn how.</a> </p></li>
          <li><p>If you want to invest more time, or are setting up a lab for students, we suggest you use the <strong>large virtual machine</strong> which contains the complete set of ATLAS Open Data 2016 datasets.  This takes 1-2 hours to download and setup.  Read on.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To learn more about the data and analyses we have prepared for you, take a look at the <a href="http://opendata.atlas.cern/books/current/openatlasdatatools/_book/" target="_blank">Software Book</a></p>
        <h1 id="virtual-machine-book-for-vm-versions-m-l-and-n">Virtual machine book for VM versions M, L and N</h1>
        <p>You will learn how to download and prepare a virtual machine to run on your computer.  This will then enable you to take a look at the ATLAS Open Data 2016 datasets.</p>
        <p>By choosing the large sized virtual machine, you have access to all the ATLAS Open Data.  </p>
        <h2 id="what-is-a-virtual-machine-">What is a virtual machine ?</h2>
        <p>A virtual machine will transform your computer into an analysis machine!</p>
        <p>Your physical computer will be the "host", while the virtual machine will be a "guest". Most of the guest code runs unmodified, directly on the host computer, and the guest operating system "thinks" it's running on a real machine.</p>
        <p>A virtual machine allows an unmodified operating system with all of its installed software to run in a special environment, on top of your existing operating system. </p>
        <p>There are two steps to setup your environment</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Get and prepare VirtualBox.  This is explained in the next two chapters.</li>
          <li>Get and run a virtual machine.  This is explained in the following two chapters.</li>
        </ol>
